# Gene conversion and crossing-over events identified from long-read sequencing of primate testes and human sperm

## Overview
This repository contains all the relevant information to reproduce the results and figures in the paper: [Gene conversion and crossing-over events identified from long-read sequencing of primate testes and human sperm](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.05.601967v1). In this paper, we build a caller that detects recombintion events using long-reads sequencing. Applying a likelihood-based method, we also classify a significant proportion of all reads in each individual, and therefore we can separate the somatic recombinations events from the germline recombination events. Across all individuals in this study, we estimate the gene conversion (GCV) tract length and the amount of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC).
